# Reminder On The Wall

This program generates a schedule about which group of a certain day is on duty (do the cleaning job). Each group is numbered, and the program will automatically generates a sequential schedule.

## TODO

* [ ] Add a preview before the wallpaper is set
* [ ] A GUI
* [ ] If someone is punished to be on-duty, make it easy to add them in
* [ ] DIY content (This would need a complex GUI...)
* [ ] Set a video as the wallpaper's background (This would be a long way)
